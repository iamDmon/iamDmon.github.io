            <p>The Nemesis Challenge<br>
It&rsquo;s been a month since I ended the 90 Day AIO Challenge in hope of starting something huge and now it&rsquo;s here. The 90DAIOC V2.0. A brand new approach to reach new heights. The Nemesis Challenge just like is predecessor aims at perfecting human flaws and engineering the brain to reach unbelievable heights. </p>

<p>Why &lsquo;Nemesis&rsquo;?<br>
I have been trying to conquer the brain since a long time, but my brain(my enemy) throws in instant gratification and procrastination, which I, like an ass enjoy. My brain, my nemesis has started seeming tougher. But this is a 2 way street. I will be punishing my brain and my body and myself for my previous actions.</p>

<p>What?<br>
As I have already briefly explained before, The Nemesis Challenge is a exercise that I will be performing to create the perfect human. The aim is to become the, &ldquo;living manifestation of destiny&rdquo;<br>
The world runs under my control. I know that I might seem like Hitler v2 with what I said,but what I actually mean is, to be so smart, know every possibility, to deduct the facts to predict the near future and change it using the few control we have.</p>

<p>How?<br>
The &ldquo;What?&rdquo; portion must have sounded ridiculous enough, but I will try to put my actions into words. I have come up with a unique plan to master every area of life. Perfecting these will ensure not only unlimited control over oneself, but also control others to some extent.</p>

<p>
The Goal</p>

<p>
- Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to experiences occurring in the present moment, which can be developed through the practice of meditation and other training.<br>
- Omniscience is the capacity to know everything that there is to know.<br>
- Speed reading is a techniques used to improve one's ability to read quickly.<br>
- Remember Everything <br>
- Meditation<br>
- BeachBody is the perfect body to look sexy af.</p>

- Earn a decent amount of money on your own.</p>

<p>The Plan</p>

<p>As I have mentioned before I will be needing to rule some areas of life. This will need a particular path and here it is</p>

<p>Basic Breakdown</p>

<p>- Wake up at 0500 <br>
- Exercise(according to the workout Plan)<br>
